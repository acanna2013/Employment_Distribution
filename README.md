### Preface
This is a project I worked on displaying different attributes between two groups: those who have difficulty paying back loans and those who do not. A good array of EDA was used, including basic statistics, data visualization, and statistical hypothetical testing. 

### Modules
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Math, Seaborn, Scipy.stats

### Hypotheses I Tested
* Hypotheses about least significant difference for OCCUPATION_TYPE:
  * H0: No difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) among private service staff.
  * H1: There is a difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) among private service staff.

* Hypotheses about most significant difference for OCCUPATION_TYPE:
  * H0: No difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) among HR staff.
  * H1: There is a difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) among HR staff.

* Hypotheses about least significant difference for NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE:
  * H0: No difference difficulty in paying back (amount credit) in those with a secondary/secondary special education.
  * H1: There is a difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) in those with a secondary/secondary special education.

* Hypotheses about most significant difference for NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE:
  * H0: No difference difficulty in paying back (amount credit) in those with an academic degree.
  * H1: There is a difference in difficulty in paying back (amount credit) in those with an academic degree.
